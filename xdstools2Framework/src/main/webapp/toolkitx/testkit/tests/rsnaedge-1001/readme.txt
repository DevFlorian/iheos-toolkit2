Single image
RSNA Edge Device test
<h2>Single image study</h2>

<p>This test with a single image is designed to test the underlying
communication requirements for an RSNA ISN Source (aka Edge Server). One
image is presented to the ISN Source along with an HL7 report. The ISN Source
is required to generate the proper ADT messages and Document Set Submission
and communicate these to the Clearinghouse simulator.</p>

<p>When the test is run:
<ol>
<stike>
<li/>The Image Document Consumer simulator (IDC sim) sends a Retrieve Image 
Document Set Request (RAD-69 Request) to the Initiating Imaging Gateway 
system under test (IIG SUT), requesting a single image.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-69 Request and send a
corresponding Cross Community Retrieve Image Document Set Request
(RAD-75 Request) to the Responding Imaging Gateway A simulator
(RIG A sim).
<li/>The RIG A sim will process the RAD-75 Request, generating a 
corresponding RAD-69 request to the Imaging Document Source A1 simulator
(IDS A1 sim).
<li/>The IDS A1 sim will process the RAD-69 request, generating a response
containing the requested image.
<li/>The RIG A sim will process the RAD-69 response, generating a RAD-75
response, which will be returned to the IIG SUT.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-75 response, generating
a RAD-69 response and returning it to the IDC sim.
<li/>The IDC sim will process the RAD-69 response and store the received
image.

</ol>
</p>

<p>
The following validations are performed:
<ol>
<strike>
<li>Returned image matches that requested.
<li>Correct format of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 responce generated by
the IIG SUT.
<li>Correct content of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 response, including
home community ID, repository unique ID, and mime type.
</strike>
</ol>
