    <title>Responding Imaging Gateway: One Multi-Image Study, Single IDS
      (F)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>One Multi-Image Study, Single IDS (F)</h2>
    <p>Tests the ability of the Responding Imaging Gateway actor (SUT)
      to respond correctly to a Cross Gateway Retrieve Imaging Document
      Set (RAD-75) transaction from an Initiating Imaging Gateway actor
      (Simulator) for a multiple image DICOM study. </p>
    <p>The Responding Imaging Gateway communicates with Imaging Document
      Source F and returns one imaging study with multiple images. </p>
    <h3>Retrieve Parameters</h3>
    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>

    <h3>Test Execution</h3>
    <p>The test consists of four steps: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Test software sends RAD-75 request to System Under test and
        records response. The request contains requests for images in
        two separate DICOM studies.<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>System Under Test sends a RAD-69 request to Imaging Document
          Source which stores the request.</li>
        <li>Imaging Document Source provides RAD-69 response to System
          Under Test.</li>
        <li>System Under Test provides RAD-75 response to test software.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Test software validates the RAD-69 request that is sent by the
        System Under Test.</li>
      <li>Test software validates the RAD-75 response sent by the System
        Under Test.</li>
      <li>Test software validates the image returned in the RAD-75
        response to make sure the System Under Test did not alter the
        image.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
