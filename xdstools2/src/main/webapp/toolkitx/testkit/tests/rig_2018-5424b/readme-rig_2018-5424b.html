    <title>Responding Imaging Gateway: Unknown DICOM UIDs, Single IDS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Unknown DICOM UIDs, Single IDS</h2>
    <p>Tests the ability of the Responding Imaging Gateway actor (SUT)
      to respond correctly to a Cross Gateway Retrieve Imaging Document
      Set (RAD-75) transaction from an Initiating Imaging Gateway actor
      (Simulator), for a single DICOM image file, in the case where the
      Image Document Source has no image with matching DICOM UID values.
    </p>
    <p>The DICOM UIDs in the RAD-69 request do not refer to an image
      that is known to the Imaging Document Source, and an error code
      will be returned by the Imaging Document Source to the Responding
      Imaging Gateway. </p>
    <h3>Retrieve Parameters</h3>
    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>RIG Home Community ID</td>

    <h3>Test Execution</h3>
    <p>The test consists of three steps: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Test software sends RAD-75 request to System Under test and
        records response.<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>System Under Test sends a RAD-69 request to Imaging Document
          Source which stores the request.</li>
        <li>Imaging Document Source provides RAD-69 response to System
          Under Test.</li>
        <li>System Under Test provides RAD-75 response to test software.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Test software validates the RAD-69 request that is sent by the
        System Under Test.</li>
      <li>Test software validates the RAD-75 response sent by the System
        Under Test.</li>
    </ol>
