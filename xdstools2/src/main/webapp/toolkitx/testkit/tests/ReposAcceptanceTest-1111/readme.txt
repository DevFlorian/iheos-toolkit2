Submit Document Entry
This test verifies the ability of the Repository to accept a single document and then accept a replacement of it.
This is broken down into two steps, each represented by the sections below:
1. Accept a submission a single document using the endpoint listed under Provide and Register.
2. Replace the document using the endpoint listed under Provide and Register.
This test also serves a secondary purpose: This test simulates a DocSrc actor and enables testing of the DocSrc Conformance Test 1111 validation plugins. Use this test to populate test data in the supporting simulators for DocSrc and ISR actors (Repository must be configured to forward Registry requests).
