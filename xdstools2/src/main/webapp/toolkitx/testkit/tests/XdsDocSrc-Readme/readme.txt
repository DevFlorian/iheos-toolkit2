XDS Document Source: Read This First
Validations in this test collection operate by scanning the simulator logs looking for messages that match a necessary pattern. The tests describe the required patterns for a particular operation. There is no requirement that the messages are submitted in a particular order or uniquely submitted for a test. For example, the XdsDocSrcSubmissionTest-1111/SubmitRplc test will verify that the simulator contains a valid RPLC anywhere in its logs.
