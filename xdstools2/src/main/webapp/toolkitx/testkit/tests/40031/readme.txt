DocumentEntry attribute Update

Each section tests the updatability of a single attribute using RMU. In each section, the first step, submit_original
submits a single DocumentEntry.  Then the second step, submit_update, updates the single attribute the section
is named for.  The final section, query, verifies that the update was accepted by the Responding Gateway.
