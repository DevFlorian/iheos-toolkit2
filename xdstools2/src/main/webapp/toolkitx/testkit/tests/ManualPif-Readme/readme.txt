Manual Patient Identity Feed (PIF): Read This First
First, Patient IDs used by these tests need to be manually registered in the System Under Test using the IDs shown above. When this is completed, all of the Initialize/Load tests below must be manually run one at a time in the order shown. Please note: you must run all tests, including the Send Patient Identity Feed, which only creates Log files in this case, to fulfill test dependency requirements. When all orchestration tests are successfully completed, the main tests can be run using the Run All button.
