Repeat retrieve

Following a Find Documents Stored Query to set up the test,
two Retrieves are issued to the Responding Gateway. The
content retrieved each time must be different.

Between the two retrieves, the operator is given the
opportunity to trigger a content update on the 
Responding Gateway (System Under Test).

This test does not require the Persistance Option.
