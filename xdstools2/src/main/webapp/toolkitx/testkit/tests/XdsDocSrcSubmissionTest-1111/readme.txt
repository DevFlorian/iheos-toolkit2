Submit Document Entry
This test verifies the ability of the Document Source to submit a single document and replace it.
This is broken down into two steps, each represented by the sections below:
1. Submit a single document using the endpoint listed under Provide and Register.
2. Replace the document using the endpoint listed under Provide and Register.
This test when validated, validates these two operations by examining the messages and the contents of the docsrc_support simulator. The first section looks for a valid submission. The second section looks for a valid RPLC.
