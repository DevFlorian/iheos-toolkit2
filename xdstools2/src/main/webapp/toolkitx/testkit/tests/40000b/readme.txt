No Original DocumentEntry

An updated DocumentEntry is submitted to the Registry. The LID contained in the update (DocumentEntry) is not found on any DocuemntEntries currently in the Registry (the logical DocumentEntry does not exist in the Registry).

The HasMember Association in the submission has the requisite PreviousVersion slot which is coded correctly.  Of course the previous version it points to does not exist.

This request must fail.
