    <title>Responding Imaging Gateway: Partial Success, Multiple Imaging
      Document Source Actors (E, F)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Partial Success, Multiple Imaging Document Source Actors (E, F)</h2>
    <p>Tests the ability of the Responding Imaging Gateway actor (SUT)
      to respond correctly to a Cross Gateway Retrieve Imaging Document
      Set (RAD-75) transaction from an Initiating Imaging Gateway actor
      (Simulator) for DICOM image files from two Imaging Document Source
      actor (Simulators), in the case where one of the files requested
      is unknown. </p>
    <p>One study is located in Imaging Document Source E. The second
      study is requested as if it exists in Imaging Document Source F,
      but the study does not in fact exist. This is simulating an error
      condition where the Responding Imaging Gateway will have to
      consolidate the results and provide a PartialSuccess status. </p>

    <h3>Test Execution</h3>
    <p>The test consists of four steps: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Test software sends RAD-75 request to System Under test and
        records response. The request contains requests for images in
        two separate DICOM studies on separate Imaging Document Source
        actors.<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>System Under Test sends <b>RAD-69 requests to Imaging
            Document Sources</b> which store the request.</li>
        <li>Imaging Document Sources provide RAD-69 <b>responses</b> to
          System Under Test.</li>
        <li>System Under Test provides RAD-75 response to test software.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Test software validates the RAD-69 request that is sent by the
        System Under Test.</li>
      <li>Test software validates the RAD-75 response sent by the System
        Under Test.</li>
      <li>Test software validates the image returned in the RAD-75
        response to make sure the System Under Test did not alter the
        image.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
