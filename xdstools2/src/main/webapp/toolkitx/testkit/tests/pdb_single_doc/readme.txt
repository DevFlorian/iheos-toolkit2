Send Provide Document Bundle
Send a Provide Document Bundle transaction (ITI-65) to a (MHD) Document Recipient SUT.

Since the (MHD) Document Recipient has no requirements to support QUERY or RETRIEVE, no
attempt is made to query or retrieve the contents. The transaction is judged on the
response returned only.
