    <title>Initiating Imaging Gateway: Partial Success, Multiple
      Gateways</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>Partial Success, Multiple Gateways</h2>
    <p>Tests the ability of the Initiating Imaging Gateway actor (SUT)
      to respond correctly to a Retrieve Image Document Set (RAD-69)
      Request from an Image Document Consumer actor (Simulator), for two
      DICOM image files from difference Responding Imaging Gateways, in
      the case where the file requested from one Gateway is unknown.</p>
    <p>One study is located in Community A. The retrieve for the second
      study is defined for Community B, but the imaging study is not
      present in Community B. The Initiating Imaging Gateway is expected
      to submit retrieve requests to both communities and provide a
      consolidated result. The consolidated result consists of a
      PartialSuccess status and the images from the study in Community
      A. </p>

    <h3>Test Execution</h3>
    <p>The test consists of four steps: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Test software sends RAD-69 request to System Under test and
        records response.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>System Under Test sends a RAD-75 request <b>to all
            Responding Imaging Gateways</b> which store the requests.</li>
        <li><i>Responding Imaging Gateways provide RAD-75 responses</i>
          to System Under Test.</li>
        <li>System Under Test <b>provides one RAD-69 response </b>to
          test software.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Test software validates the RAD-75 requests that are sent by
        the System Under Test.</li>
      <li>Test software validates the RAD-69 response sent by the System
        Under Test.</li>
      <li>Test software validates the image returned in the RAD-69
        response to make sure the System Under Test did not alter the
        image.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
