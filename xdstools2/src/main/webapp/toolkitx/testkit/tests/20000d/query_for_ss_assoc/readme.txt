This uses a GetAssociations query setting the parameter, $uuid, equal to the XDSSubmissionSet.entryUUID for the latest version of the Folder and $MetadataLevel equals two (2). 
 
The query should return three Association objects: 1) Two associations that were required to be generated by the Document Registry when association propagation is requested, and 2) the SS-HM Association for the new version of the Folder object submitted.

The following validations are run on the query results:

* same_sourceObject - All Associations have the same @sourceObject, the SubmissionSet
* approved_status - All SS-HM Associations are Approved. 
* prev_is_version_1 – The SS-HM Association contains the slot, PreviousVersion, that has a value equaled to one (1).  This was the SS-HM Association submitted as part of the request.
* other_no_previousversion – The other two SS-HM Associations do not contain the slot, PreviousVersion, indicating that they were generated by the Document Registry.
