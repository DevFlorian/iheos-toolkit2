Run two queries to verify that the submission in the previous step was processed correctly by the Document Registry:
* GetDocuments stored query is executed to return both the original and update version of the DocumentEntry object (Document 01). Checks are performed on the results to confirm the object's status and version.
* GetRelatedDocuments stored query is executed to confirm that the latest version of the DocumentEntry object (Document 01) is now associated with the other original DocumentEntry object (Document 02) submitted in the first section of this test.
