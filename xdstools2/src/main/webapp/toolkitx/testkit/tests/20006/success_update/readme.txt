Test the ability to detect the following: 
* Metadata Update for a new version of the Document Entry with Association Propagation set to "no".
* Submit Association for an APND relationship between both Document Entries.

This transaction should succeed. 

For this test, we'll assume that the Document Administrator correctly associated the new Relationship Association with the latest version of the Document Entry.  

See Update Planning (pending CP).
