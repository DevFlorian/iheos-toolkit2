Append and Transform Document Entry

SubmitSingleDoc submits a single Document Entry submission.

SubmitApnd submits a valid APND operation.

SubmitXfrmRplc submits a valid XFRM_RPLC of an APND.

This test also serves a secondary purpose: This test simulates a DocSrc actor and enables testing of the DocSrc Conformance Test 1112 validation plugins. Use this test to populate test data in the supporting simulators for DocSrc and ISR actors (Repository must be configured to forward Registry requests).
