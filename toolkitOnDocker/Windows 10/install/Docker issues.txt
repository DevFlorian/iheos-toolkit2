2. DNS Issues
If you cannot ping from a running container then you should check your Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connectons > DockerNAT TCP/IPv4 Properties. In the General Tab, you may want to try the DHCP Setting for the Automatic IP address and then enter your DNS in the 'Use the following DNS server addresses' panel. Next, In the Alternate Configuration tab, Select User configured option and enter the Docker IP address, Subnet mask, and the Preferred DNS server.
